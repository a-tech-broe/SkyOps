## AI Voice Brief

Available on the Weather, NOTAMs, Airports, and Route Briefing pages. After loading data, a **Voice Brief** button appears. Clicking it:

1. Sends the loaded data to the backend
2. Claude Haiku generates a plain-English aviation briefing (60–120 words)
3. After a 3-second pause, the browser reads it aloud using the Web Speech API

The voice picker selects the most natural-sounding voice available: Google neural → Apple Samantha → any Enhanced US English voice → fallback US English.

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be set. Returns a `503` with a clear error message if the key is missing.

---

## Accounts & Password Reset

Sign-up and login use email + password, with sessions carried as a JWT (`skybroe_token` in `localStorage`, signed with `JWT_SECRET`).

Password reset is self-service:

1. `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` — always returns the same response (so it never reveals whether an email is registered). If the address exists, a single-use token (1-hour expiry) is stored in `password_reset_tokens` and a reset email is sent.
2. The email is sent via **Amazon SES** from `SES_FROM_EMAIL` and links to `${APP_URL}/reset-password?token=…`.
3. `POST /api/auth/reset-password` — validates the token and sets the new password.

> Delivery requires a **verified SES sender identity** and, for arbitrary recipients, **SES production access** (a new account is in the SES sandbox and can only send to verified addresses). The EC2 instance role grants `ses:SendEmail`; ensure the running container can reach instance-role credentials.

---

## Aviation Observability Platform (Ops Overview)

> "Datadog for aviation operations" — live flight-condition monitoring for a set of route stations.

The **Ops** page (`/ops`) provides a real-time health overview of any airports you care about:

- Add/remove stations by ICAO — saved to `localStorage`
- Each station shows its current flight rules badge (VFR / MVFR / IFR / LIFR), wind, visibility, ceiling, and altimeter
- Global counters: active SIGMETs and TFRs
- Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes with a live countdown
- Quick links to the Map and Dispatch pages for deeper investigation

### Interactive stat tiles

Each of the four summary cards at the top is clickable:

| Tile | Action |
|---|---|
| **Tracked Routes** | Smooth-scrolls to the Route Health table below |
| **IFR / LIFR Airports** | Expands an inline panel listing every IFR or LIFR airport across all tracked routes with its FR badge, wind, visibility, and which routes it belongs to. Click again or ✕ to dismiss. |
| **Active SIGMETs** | Navigates to the Weather Map (`/map`) where the SIGMET GeoJSON layer is rendered |
| **Active TFRs** | Navigates to the Weather Map (`/map`) where the TFR GeoJSON layer is rendered |

---

## Operational Replay Timeline

> "Flight incident replay system" — scrub through historical weather conditions at any tracked airport.

The **Replay** page (`/replay`) records a weather snapshot every 15 minutes for each airport you add to tracking. Data is kept for 7 days.

### Controls

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Airport selector | Choose from tracked airports |
| Window buttons | 6 h · 12 h · 24 h · 48 h · 72 h lookback |
| Play / Pause | Step through snapshots at 600 ms per frame |
| Rewind | Jump back to the oldest snapshot in the window |
| Timeline bar | Color-coded segments (VFR/MVFR/IFR/LIFR) — click any segment to jump |
| Scrubber | Range slider for fine-grained navigation |

### Snapshot card

Each snapshot shows: flight rules badge, wind (direction/speed/gust), visibility, temperature, altimeter, and raw METAR string.

### Tracking management

Add any ICAO to the tracked list from the bottom panel. The first snapshot appears within 15 minutes. The background collector runs automatically at backend startup.

### Database schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE tracked_airports (
  icao     TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  added_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE obs_snapshots (
  id           UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  icao         TEXT NOT NULL,
  captured_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  flight_rules TEXT NOT NULL,
  raw_metar    TEXT,
  wdir         TEXT,
  wspd         SMALLINT,
  wgst         SMALLINT,
  visib        TEXT,
  temp         NUMERIC(5,1),
  altim        NUMERIC(6,2)
);

CREATE INDEX obs_snapshots_icao_time ON obs_snapshots (icao, captured_at DESC);
```

## Airport Details

The Airport page is designed for preflight planning — useful for both student pilots and airline crews.

### Tabs

| Tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Name · location · elevation · longest runway · METAR · wind indicator · IFR/LIFR alert · sunrise/sunset (UTC) · frequencies · density altitude calculator · nearby alternates (50 nm) |
| **Runways** | Embedded airport diagram (APD) for taxi planning · runway ends ranked by wind favor · headwind/crosswind components · per-runway IAP approach plate links |
| **Charts** | Full FAA d-TPP chart list grouped by type, linked to current-cycle PDFs |

### Runway Wind Analysis

Runway ends are sorted by how well they align with the reported surface wind. For each end the page shows:

- **HW** — headwind component in knots
- **XW** — crosswind component in knots
- **Best** badge on the most favorable end
- Runway length and surface type (Asphalt, Concrete, Gravel, Turf)

Wind is parsed from the live METAR fetched alongside airport data.

### Embedded Airport Diagram

If an Airport Diagram (APD) exists in the current AIRAC cycle, it is rendered inline at the top of the Runways tab as a scrollable PDF — no need to open a separate tab for taxi routing. A **Full screen** link opens the PDF in a new tab.

### Per-Runway Approach Plates

Each runway end card expands to list every IAP chart whose name references that runway (e.g. `ILS OR LOC RWY 24R`, `RNAV (GPS) Z RWY 24R`). Clicking any plate opens the PDF in a new tab. This means a pilot can see wind favor, surface type, and all available instrument approaches for a specific runway in a single view.

### IFR / LIFR Alert

When the METAR indicates IFR or LIFR conditions **and** the airport has FAA approach plates, a color-coded banner appears in the Overview tab:

| Condition | Banner color |
|---|---|
| IFR | Red |
| LIFR | Magenta |

The banner includes a **View Approaches →** button that jumps to the Charts tab with the Instrument Approaches (IAP) section highlighted.

### FAA d-TPP Charts

Chart data is sourced from the FAA digital Terminal Procedures Publication (d-TPP). Coverage is limited to US airports with ICAO identifiers starting with **K**, **P**, or **A**. International airports display a notice to consult the national AIP or Jeppesen.

| Chart code | Type |
|---|---|
| APD | Airport Diagram |
| IAP | Instrument Approach Procedures |
| DP | Departure Procedures (SIDs) |
| STAR | Standard Terminal Arrivals |
| MIN | Takeoff Minimums & Obstacle Departure Procedures |
| HOT | Airport Hot Spots |

Charts are updated automatically each [AIRAC cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIRAC) (28-day interval). The current cycle identifier is shown at the top of the Charts tab. The backend caches the d-TPP XML index in memory and clears it on cycle change. If the current cycle index is unavailable on the FAA server, the previous cycle is used as a fallback automatically.

### Sunrise & Sunset

The Overview tab computes today's sunrise, solar noon, and sunset times in UTC using the NOAA solar calculator algorithm — no API call required. Useful for planning night currency flights or checking civil twilight for passenger carrying.

### Density Altitude Calculator

Enter the current altimeter setting (in Hg) and OAT (°C) to compute density altitude on the spot. Color-coded output: green below 5,000 ft, orange above 5,000 ft, red above 8,000 ft. A performance warning appears when DA is more than 2,000 ft above field elevation.

### Nearby Alternates

Click **Load** in the Overview tab to fetch up to 8 airports within 50 nm, sorted by distance, each with its current METAR. Clicking an alternate ICAO immediately searches that airport. Useful for alternate planning under FAR 91.169 / FAR 121.

---

## Winds Aloft

The Winds Aloft page fetches the FAA FD 6-hour forecast for any US station and displays a formatted table:

| Column | Detail |
|---|---|
| Altitude | 3,000 ft through FL390 |
| Direction | Degrees magnetic (000–360); "L & V" for light and variable |
| Speed | Knots; red ≥ 50 kt, orange ≥ 30 kt |
| Temp (°C) | Blue below −40°C, orange above +5°C |
| ISA Dev | Actual temp − standard atmosphere temp at that altitude; orange = warmer than ISA (DA higher than indicated) |

FD winds use 3-letter station identifiers (K-prefix stripped). The parser handles the full FD text format including the high-speed encoding (DD > 36 → subtract 50, add 100 kts).

---

## Route Briefing

Enter a departure, destination, and optional alternate ICAO to generate a preflight briefing strip. Each station card shows:

- Flight rules category (VFR / MVFR / IFR / LIFR)
- Raw METAR
- Full TAF (pre-formatted)
- NOTAM count badge

Data for all stations is fetched in parallel. A **Voice Brief** button summarizes the entire route in plain English via Claude AI. Useful as a quick "one-page" preflight awareness check before pulling a full ATC briefing.

---

## Currency Tracker

Tracks FAR 61 recency requirements — stored entirely in the browser (`localStorage`), no account required.

| Requirement | FAR | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Day VFR (pax) | 61.57(a) | 3 takeoffs & landings in preceding 90 days |
| Night VFR (pax) | 61.57(b) | 3 full-stop night landings in preceding 90 days |
| IFR | 61.57(c) | 6 instrument approaches + hold + intercept/track in preceding 6 calendar months |
| Flight Review | 61.56 | 1 hr ground + 1 hr flight in preceding 24 calendar months |

Each currency card shows the current count, a color-coded status badge (current / not current), and days until expiry or days since expiry. A flight log table tracks individual entries (date, aircraft, day/night landings, approaches, holding). The last flight review or IPC date is stored separately.

---

## Mobile App

The native mobile app (Expo / React Native) targets iOS and Android and is optimised for everyday use on the flight line — no browser required.

### Screens

| Screen | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Weather** | ICAO METAR lookup — wind, visibility, altimeter, temp/dew, cloud layers, flight rules badge (VFR / MVFR / IFR / LIFR), raw METAR string |
| **NOTAMs** | ICAO NOTAM lookup via FAA API — number, effective dates, full text |
| **Airports** | ICAO airport lookup — elevation, lat/lon, longest runway, runway directions |

### Navigation

Screens are laid out as a **horizontal swipe-pager**: swipe left or right to move between Weather → NOTAMs → Airports. The tab strip at the top stays fixed — it scrolls independently from the content panels and never moves when you scroll within a screen. Tapping a tab label jumps to that panel; the sliding indicator bar tracks the active page.

### Responsive layout

The `useLayout()` hook drives every size value (font, padding, border radius, touch targets, grid columns) and re-runs automatically on orientation change. The pager re-snaps to the correct page after rotation so no content is lost.

| Device class | Stat grid | Font scale | Content width |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phone portrait | 2 columns | base | full width |
| Phone landscape | 3 columns | base | full width |
| iPad portrait | 3 columns | +2 pt | max 720 px centred |
| iPad landscape | 4 columns | +2 pt | max 720 px centred |

### Running the mobile app

```bash
cd app/mobile
npm install
npx expo start          # opens Metro — scan QR with Expo Go on device
npx expo start --ios    # or --android for simulator
```

Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `app/mobile/.env` (or export it) to point at the running backend before launching.

---

## Dispatch Strip

Enter any number of ICAO codes (space or comma-separated) to get a parallel weather pull for all stations simultaneously. Each station is summarized in a single row:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| Category | VFR / MVFR / IFR / LIFR derived from METAR |
| Wind | Direction @ speed (with gust if reported) |
| Vis | Statute miles |
| Ceiling | Lowest BKN or OVC layer |
| Temp/Dew | °C / °C |
| Altimeter | Inches Hg |

On mobile, stations render as stacked cards instead of a table. Useful for airline dispatcher route planning, multi-leg charter ops, or checking a string of alternates.

---

## Search History

Every ICAO lookup (Weather, NOTAMs, Airports) is persisted in PostgreSQL tied to an anonymous device UUID stored in `localStorage`. History is per-device and survives browser restarts.

### How it works

1. On first visit the browser generates a UUID and stores it as `skybroe_device_id` in `localStorage`
2. Every search fires a background `POST /api/history` with the device ID, ICAO, and search type
3. Clicking any search input fetches `GET /api/history?deviceId=...&type=...` and shows a dropdown of recent lookups (deduplicated by airport, most recent first, top 10)
4. Selecting a history item fills the field and immediately triggers the search

### Database schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE search_history (
  id          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  device_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
  icao        TEXT NOT NULL,
  search_type TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'airport' | 'weather' | 'notam'
  searched_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

Two workflows cover the full DevSecOps lifecycle.

### `ci.yml` — every PR and `dev` push

| Job | Tool | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Secret scan | Gitleaks (full history) | Blocks |
| Lint & type check | Hadolint + `tsc --noEmit` | Blocks |
| Dependency audit | `npm audit --audit-level=critical` | Blocks |
| SAST | Semgrep | SARIF → Security tab |
| Build & CVE scan | Docker Buildx + Trivy (FS + image) | Warn, SARIF → Security tab |
| Infra plan | `terraform plan` preview | Blocks (PR only) |

### `cd.yml` — merge to `main` / version tags

Runs all security gates, then:

| Job | What happens |
|---|---|
| Build & push | Multi-arch (`amd64` + `arm64`) → DockerHub + Trivy scan + Cosign sign + SBOM |
| Infra apply | `terraform apply` — re-imports survivors, then provisions EC2, ALB, ACM, SGs, CloudWatch/RUM |
| Deploy | SSH → app EC2 — writes `.env` + `docker-compose.prod.yml` → `docker compose up` |
| Production smoke test | HTTPS `curl` against `APP_DOMAIN`: `/health`, web HTML, weather and airport endpoints |
| Summary | Release digest table + `cosign verify` instructions |

On a state-loss recovery (e.g. after a teardown that wiped Terraform state), `infra apply` first re-imports every surviving `do_not_delete` resource so Terraform reconciles instead of colliding with existing infrastructure.

### `cleanup.yml` — manual teardown

Manually dispatched, with a typed `DESTROY` confirmation and **dry-run on by default**. Walks resources in dependency order (Route53 → ALB → EC2 → security groups → ACM → observability → IAM → optional TF state) and **skips anything tagged `do_not_delete = true`**, so a normal run destroys only the EC2 instance and ALB. Set `dry_run=false` to actually delete; `clean_tf_state=true` additionally wipes the remote state file.

### GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Used by |
|---|---|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | CD — push, sign, deploy |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | CD — push |
| `DB_USER` | CD — written to app EC2 `.env` |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | CD — written to app EC2 `.env` |
| `FAA_CLIENT_ID` | CD — written to app EC2 `.env` |
| `FAA_CLIENT_SECRET` | CD — written to app EC2 `.env` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | CD — written to app EC2 `.env`; signs auth tokens |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | CD — written to app EC2 `.env`; required for AI voice brief |
| `APP_DOMAIN` | CD — ACM cert domain + smoke tests (e.g. `skybroe.example.com`) |
| `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` | CI/CD — Route53 hosted zone ID for auto DNS validation + A records (optional) |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | CI infra plan + CD infra apply |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | CI infra plan + CD infra apply |
| `AWS_REGION` | Optional — defaults to `us-east-1` |
| `TF_BACKEND_BUCKET` | Terraform S3 state bucket name |
| `TF_BACKEND_DYNAMO_TABLE` | Terraform DynamoDB lock table name |
| `EC2_HOST` | App server Elastic IP — allocate before first deploy, set as secret |
| `EC2_SSH_KEY` | Private key content (PEM) for app EC2 |
| `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN` | Optional — enables Semgrep cloud dashboard |

---

## Infrastructure

### Architecture

```
Internet
   │
   ▼
Application Load Balancer  (HTTPS :443 — TLS terminated)
   │  HTTP :80 → 301 redirect to HTTPS
   │
   ├── /api/*  ──────► App EC2 :3001  (Node.js API)
   ├── /health ──────► App EC2 :3001
   └── /*      ──────► App EC2 :80    (nginx → React SPA)

App EC2  (m5.xlarge)
├── web      :80
└── backend  :3001
```

### What gets provisioned

| Resource | Detail |
|---|---|
| App EC2 | Amazon Linux 2023, `m5.xlarge`, 30 GB gp3 encrypted |
| ALB | Application Load Balancer — HTTP→HTTPS redirect, path-based routing, access logs → S3 |
| ACM | TLS certificate for `APP_DOMAIN` — DNS validated |
| Internet gateway | The default VPC's existing IGW, referenced as a **data source** (not created — a default VPC already has one) |
| Security groups | ALB SG (80+443 public); App SG |
| IAM role | Least-privilege — SSM read scoped to `/skybroe/*`, SES send, CloudWatch agent, X-Ray |
| Elastic IP | Pre-allocated — referenced as a data source, never recreated by Terraform |
| Observability | CloudWatch dashboard, metric alarms, log groups, RUM, SNS alerts, S3 ALB-log bucket (see below) |

### Protected vs. disposable resources

Every free / near-zero-cost resource (networking, IAM, ACM, target groups, listeners, and the entire observability stack) is tagged `do_not_delete = true`, and most also carry `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }`. Only the two cost-incurring resources — the **EC2 instance** and the **ALB** — are left disposable. This lets the `cleanup` workflow tear down the expensive pieces while preserving the scaffolding for cheap re-provisioning.

### Observability

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | `SkyBroe-Overview` — EC2 CPU/mem/disk/network, ALB request count / latency / status codes, and live app-log query widgets |
| Alarms | CPU, memory, disk, ALB 5xx, ALB p95 latency, unhealthy hosts → SNS topic `skybroe-alerts` (email on `alarm_email`) |
| Logs | CloudWatch log groups `/skybroe/app` (30 d) and `/skybroe/system` (14 d); CloudWatch agent config in SSM |
| RUM | CloudWatch RUM app monitor `skybroe-web` with a Cognito guest identity pool for browser telemetry |
| ALB access logs | Shipped to S3 bucket `skybroe-alb-logs-<account>`, expired after 90 days |

### First-time setup

1. Allocate an Elastic IP in your AWS account for the app EC2
2. Set `EC2_HOST` GitHub Secret to that IP **before the first run**
3. Create an EC2 key pair named `keyit` in your AWS account
4. Register a domain and point it at AWS (Route53 recommended)
5. Add all remaining GitHub Secrets listed above
6. Push to `main` — the pipeline provisions the server and deploys the app

**With Route53 (`HOSTED_ZONE_ID` set):** DNS validation and A records are created automatically.

**Without Route53:** Check `terraform output acm_validation_records`, add the CNAMEs at your registrar, then re-run the workflow.

### Manual infra operations

```bash
cd infra/terraform

terraform init \
  -backend-config="bucket=YOUR_BUCKET" \
  -backend-config="key=ec2/terraform.tfstate" \
  -backend-config="region=us-east-1" \
  -backend-config="dynamodb_table=YOUR_LOCK_TABLE" \
  -backend-config="encrypt=true"

terraform plan   # preview
terraform apply  # provision
```
